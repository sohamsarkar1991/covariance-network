# Covariance Networks (CovNet) 

Covariance estimation for functional data using neural network architectures.

See ``Demo.ipynb`` for demonstration and details about the available functions.

Codes used to produce the results in the paper are in the **`Codes`** folder. Some modification of the codes were used to handle the fMRI data. These modified codes are marked with an extra **fMRI** in the name.
